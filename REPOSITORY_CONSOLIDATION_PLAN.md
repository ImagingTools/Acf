# ACF Repository Consolidation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document proposes consolidating three separate ACF repositories (Acf, AcfSln, IAcf) into a single unified repository with a domain-oriented structure. This consolidation will improve maintainability, discoverability, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality.

## Current State

### Four Separate Repositories

1. **Acf** (Core Framework)
   - **Purpose**: Foundation framework and infrastructure
   - **Libraries**: 27 libraries
   - **Focus**: Core components, Qt integration, basic utilities
   - **Status**: Active, well-documented

2. **AcfSln** (Application Packages)
   - **Purpose**: Domain-specific business logic
   - **Libraries**: 33 libraries  
   - **Focus**: Imaging, calibration, measurement, production
   - **Status**: Active, application-focused

3. **IAcf** (Integration Packages)
   - **Purpose**: Third-party integrations
   - **Libraries**: 11 libraries
   - **Focus**: OpenCV, Qwt, QScintilla, Phonon, platform-specific
   - **Status**: Active, integration-focused

4. **ImtCore** (Enterprise Application Core)
   - **Purpose**: Enterprise application infrastructure
   - **Libraries**: 7+ libraries
   - **Focus**: Database, authentication, services, application framework
   - **Status**: Active, enterprise-focused

**Total**: 78+ libraries across 4 repositories

## Problems with Current Structure

### 1. Repository Fragmentation
- Related functionality scattered across four repositories
- Difficult to understand overall framework capabilities
- Complex dependency management between repositories
- Four separate build systems to maintain

### 2. Poor Discoverability
- Users don't know which repository contains needed functionality
- No clear organization by functional domain
- Technical layering doesn't match user mental models
- Documentation fragmented across repositories

### 3. Maintenance Overhead
- Four separate release cycles
- Duplicate infrastructure (CI/CD, docs, issues)
- Inconsistent versioning across repos
- Complex cross-repository changes

### 4. Dependency Challenges
- Cross-repository dependencies complicate builds
- Circular dependency risks
- Difficult to extract subsets of functionality
- Version synchronization issues

## Proposed Solution: Unified Domain-Oriented Repository

### Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: One repository for all ACF code
2. **Domain Organization**: Group by what libraries do, not how they're implemented
3. **Layered Architecture**: Clear dependency hierarchy
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work
5. **Flexible Building**: Build full framework or domain subsets

### Proposed Domain Structure

- No breaking changes
- Existing projects work without modification

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Comprehensive Backups**: Full backup of all three repositories
2. **Parallel Testing**: Test new structure while keeping old repos
3. **Gradual Migration**: Domain-by-domain approach
4. **Rollback Plan**: Clear rollback procedure documented
5. **Compatibility Layer**: Symlinks ensure old paths work
